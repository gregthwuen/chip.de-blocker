# Chip.de Blocker
GitHub repository for the Chrome extension Chip.de Blocker. Keeps Chip.de from loading.

## Manual installation
1. Clone the repository or download it as a zip (and unpack it)
2. Open chrome://extensions/ (via url or omnibox/menu -> Tools -> Extensions) and tick the checkbox for developer mode in the upper right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked extension"
4. Select the directory containing the unpacked extension, that means the folder with the manifest.json directly in it.
5. To update the extension when it changed, click the reload button right next to the disable/enable extension switch in the extension overview (restart of the browser should update the extension too).
5. Note: In the standard channel for the Chrome, you will get a pop up with "Disable developer mode extensions" every time you open a new browser window. It can be quite annoying. You can go around that by downloading the dev or canary version of Chrome.
7. Of course, if the extension comes to the Web Store, there will be no warnings and no need to refresh/update the extension manually.
